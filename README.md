FIX:
**********
*   Layout: Just been configured to work on vuetify v2.0
*   Calllog
*   Oyatel API
*   agents space between // css not sure if best approach
*   Hold caller info during the call

TODO:
**********
*   Changelog on server, icon for author of the change
*   Change request page: in app and the system, anon and logged
*   Send call to zendesk, API setup for the supporttickets
*   Login page for Oyatel if cookie is not present

Long term:
**********
*   Select only the modules you want to see
*   Total calling time per agent
*   DB with emails
*   DB with numbers and total calling time
*   Service worker for desktop notifications
*   hitta.se -> too expensive, free alternative?
*   Chat for the agents; skype, slack, teams, discord
*   Dashboard for agents; like how many callstaken and so forth
